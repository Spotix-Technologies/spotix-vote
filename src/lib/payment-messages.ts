 * Some buyers transfer either above or below the expected amount. When the
 * backend reconciles a reference against Paystack and the gateway comes
 * back with that message, we mark the reference `incorrect_payment`
 * instead of leaving it as a generic "failed" so the UI can explain what
 * actually happened and how it gets resolved.
